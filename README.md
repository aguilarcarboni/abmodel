NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2023 - Make a Moonquake Map 2.0!

#### Summary of the Project
At present, NASA possesses a repository of seismological data obtained during the Apollo missions conducted between 1969 and 1977. The potential utilization of this data to generate a seismic map opens the door to the development of projects such as identifying regions with a higher density of seismic activity, representing a threat to future space missions. The solution offered by the application lies in the planning of suitable landing sites for projects like the Artemis program, which aims to establish a base on the Moon through the use of heat maps. This would provide companies interested in investing in lunar and solar system travel with an economic advantage, knowing that the infrastructure is located in a historically seismically stable area. Vital systems such as water production for drinking, oxygen purification for breathing, essential station power generation, and onboard technology would be situated on stable ground, seismically speaking. Furthermore, the generation of a seismological map would facilitate future geological studies. By analyzing the propagation of waves through the medium, it becomes possible to study the internal composition of the Moon, leading to a better understanding of the dynamics of not only the Moon but also Earth and other celestial bodies.
#### Objective:
To develop a publicly accessible application for visualizing lunar earthquakes. General information will be provided to help users understand essential concepts such as earthquakes, the Moon, past missions, and the operation of seismometers. This approach ensures that users not only gain knowledge but also have a comprehensive interactive experience.

#### How It Was Developed:
The application was developed using the JavaScript React library for all the interactive interface and Python programming language for data processing. A GitHub repository was created to manage the coding tasks for plotting seismic data points based on their latitude and longitude coordinates. Additionally, the programming of filters that can be applied to the map was implemented through this repository. The web design, including its presentation and interface, was also programmed using the same platform.
